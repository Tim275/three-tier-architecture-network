## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites




## âœ¨ Features

- **High Availability**: The architecture is designed for fault tolerance and redundancy.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the web and application tiers to handle varying workloads.
- **Security**: Security groups and network ACLs are configured to ensure a secure environment.

## ðŸŒŸ Web Tier

The Web Tier is the entry point for incoming user requests. It typically includes:

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.
- **Security Groups**: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers.



## ðŸš€ Application Tier

The Application Tier hosts the application servers responsible for running business logic and interacting with the database tier. Key components include:

- **Application Servers**: These run your application code and can be horizontally scaled.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to the application servers.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.
- **Security Groups**: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the application servers.



## ðŸ’½ Database Tier

The Database Tier stores and manages our application data. We use Amazon RDS for a managed database service. Key components include:

- **Amazon RDS**: A managed database service for MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server databases.
- **Security Groups**: Control incoming and outgoing traffic to the database.




## ðŸ’¼ Usage

### Scaling
- To scale the Web or Application Tier, use Auto Scaling configurations provided in the respective Terraform files. Adjust the desired capacity to match your scaling requirements.
### Database Management
- Access the Amazon RDS instance in the Database Tier to manage your data.
### Load Balancing
- Configure the load balancer in the Web and Application Tiers to distribute traffic evenly.
### Security Considerations
- Review and customize the security groups and network ACLs to meet your specific security requirements.
